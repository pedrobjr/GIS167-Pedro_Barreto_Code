    "1. Clean up your code before you submit it.\n",
    "    - Remove unnecessairy cells or lines of code you really don't need\n",
    "    - Make sure only necessary things remain\n",
    "2. Comment your code.\n",
    "    - At the top it is nice to have a heading that contains the code name, author, and maybe some information about what the code does.\n",
    "    - Within the code, add comments to parts of the code that might be confusing or hard to understand.\n",
    "    - Don't go totally crazy with comments, you can comment too much.\n",
    "3. Use descriptive variables names\n",
    "    - The best code is readable and easy to understand.\n",
    "    - The more your variables describe what is contained, the better."
